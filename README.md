AI Quiz Bot is a Python-based interactive quiz application integrated with a SQL Server database. The system is designed to conduct topic-wise multiple-choice quizzes using a scalable, database-driven architecture. It automatically initializes the database, loads quiz questions, conducts quizzes based on user-selected topics, evaluates answers using fuzzy matching, and stores user scores for leaderboard tracking.

The application uses Python as the front end for user interaction and SQL Server as the back end for persistent data storage. It supports multiple programming topics such as Python, SQL, C, and Java, with an expandable question bank. The project demonstrates real-world concepts including database connectivity, automation, and modular software design.
